# umbPublisher - an Obsidian plugin.

This plugin allows you to push your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes to [Umbraco 15+](https://umbraco.com) as a content item. 

It uses the Management API within Umbraco to create notes in Markdown format. You will need to create an API user in Umbraco for this to work. 

To see how to use this plugin with Obsidian, check out the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/OwainWilliams/umbpublisher/wiki)
